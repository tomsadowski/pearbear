There are 3 layers: Alpha Layer, Mouse Layer, and Number Layer. From any of those layers, the other two layers can be momentarily accessed by holding either of the space buttons.

Note: Since holding down the left-click button is a common use case, you must first access the Alpha Layer with the left thumb before accessing the Number Layer with the right thumb.

## Combos  
The caps-lock combo only turns caps-lock on. Caps-lock is turned off when a modifier or layer-switching combo is pressed.
