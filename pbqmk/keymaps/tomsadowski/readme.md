## Layers    
There are 3 layers: Alpha Layer, Mouse Layer, and Number Layer. From any of those three layers, the other two layers can be momentarily accessed by pressing and holding either of the space buttons.

### Alpha Layer

### Mouse Layer
Note: Since holding down the left-click button is a common use case, you must first access the Alpha Layer with the left thumb before accessing the Number Layer with the right thumb.

## Combos

Note the Caps-Lock combo only turns Caps-Lock on. Caps-Lock is turned off when a modifier or layer-switching combo is pressed.

## Reset Buttons    
The small buttons on the top-left-corner and top-right-corner of the keyboard are the Reset Buttons. Press the button on the plugged-in half of the keyboard to Reset the keyboard's state. Note that this is the only way to exit the 2D-Game-Layer and 3D-Game-Layer. You will also use these buttons if and when you flash the CPU with firmware modifications/updates.   


## Bonus: Left Hand Layers
