There are 3 layers: Alpha Layer, Mouse Layer, and Number Layer. From any of those layers, the functionality of the other two layers can be momentarily accessed by holding either of the space buttons. The visuals below should clarify this.

Remarks: Since holding down the left-click button is a common use-case, you must first access the Alpha Layer with the left thumb before accessing the Number Layer with the right thumb.
